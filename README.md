<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is an art website/blog built for a friend to display his artwork and blog posts. This project has been
put together in a hacky way as this is my first time using Django, HTMX, and Alpine JS. The site gives my friend/any
approved user the ability to change the images/fonts/font-colors/etc. and it behaves mostly like an SPA.

<h4>Tech Stack:</h4> Django ~ HTMX ~ Alpine JS ~ Tailwind CSS ~ Postgres ~ Docker ~ Google Cloud  <br><br>
